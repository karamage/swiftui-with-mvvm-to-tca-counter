Example code for SwiftUI to migrate from MVVM to TCA

## Summary

This is a comparison code for SwiftUI, using MVVM and TCA.

In the era of declarative UI, a composable (parts can be assembled) architecture is required.

In other words, if the architecture is "easy to make UI components" and "easy to combine those components," the benefits of declarative UI can be maximized.

TCA, as the name suggests, is a "Composable" architecture.

MVVM, however, is not a composable architecture.

This sample code illustrates this.
